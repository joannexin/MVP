There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Rating your cohort-mate and leave some advises

## Summary ##
  > Rating and writing comments to every cohort-mates through mini-yelp so that they can improve themselves by
  avoiding embarrassment.

## Problem ##
  > People somehow don't know how to communicate with everybody else to find out if they need improve or not. And
  usually it's wired that you grab someone and ask them that "Hey, can you rate me and give me some advises?"

## Solution ##
  > I create this mini-yelp so that people can rate all your cohort-mates so that they can get all the ratings and advises to avoid embarrassment. Widely, you can rate anyone in the world and leave some comments.

## Quote from You ##
  > “Rate me today and get better tomorrow”

## How to Get Started ##
  > simply choose the person who you would like to rate, write some comments.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Sean said he enjoyed so much from this app because he got many advises from cohort-mates and he is improving
  himself a lot.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Thank you so much to spend time on my README.
  Go rate your cohort-mates!!!
